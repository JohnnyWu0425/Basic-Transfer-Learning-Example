# Basic-Transfer-Learning-Example

## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to implement the idea of transfer learning. 
I use InceptionV3, loading its pre-trained weight and append some custimized dense layers to classify cats and dogs.

## Overfitting Problem
In addition to implementing transfer learning, I want to show the power of **dropout layer**. Therefore, I create two model; one of them has a dropout layer appended.

## Dataset
In this notebook, I use [dogs and cats image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images) which can be downloaded from kaggle.
